This is a MATLAB transcript to calculate the dynamics of flexible blade in
unsteady flow (wave with/without current). This code is developed by 
Dr. Longhuan Zhu to analyze the asymmetric motion of vegetation in waves 
(Zhu et al., 2020). The code was validated by laboratory experiments in
Luhar and Nepf (2016) and Zeller et al. (2014). The model validation case 
with Luhar and Nepf (2016) is referred to mainFunction_ValidationLuhar2016.m
and the general case with linear waves is referred to
mainFunction_LinearWaveTest.m
